Security Professional & Creative Engineer working at the intersection of **Offensive Security** and **AI Engineering**.  
I design and prototype **autonomous agents**, **CTF-ready tools**, and **satirical systems** with real-world impact.

- 🧠 Red Teaming | AI Toolchains | OSINT | PrivEsc | Post-Exploitation
- ⚙️ From bash to backend – if it saves time or breaks rules, I’ll build it
- 🧪 Always testing, always iterating, always weird
